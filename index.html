        Online banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. 
        Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.


Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking, available both on desktop versions and through mobile apps.
